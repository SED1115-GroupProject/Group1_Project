Objective:
Design a program, in python, that allows a Pico microcontroller to control a brachiograph, with three servo devices. 
One servo device acts as a “shoulder” joint, another acts as an “elbow” joint and a third device is used to lower/raise a pen. 
These are all under the control of two potentiometers, one controlling X movement and another controlling Y movement, in the style of an “Etch a Sketch” toy.
